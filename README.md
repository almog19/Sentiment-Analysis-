# Sentiment-Analysis-
This repository contains a learning and testing process of supervised machine learning model for sentiment analysis classifiers which has tested many ways to achieve different results, which get input sentences and categorize them into three categories: 
- Positive
- Negative
- Neutral 
The project demonstrates end-to-end Natural Language Processing (NLP) workflow development, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment-ready inference.

##techniques used:
1) NLP Preprocessing: tokenization, stopword removal(in some models), lemmatization .
2) Feature Extraction: TF-IDF, word embeddings (implemented both, word embedding has achieved better results).
3) Modeling: neural network classifier (embedding layer, biLSTM).
4) Evaluation: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-Score, and confusion matrix.
5) Production-Ready: Includes a standalone prediction script for easy deployment or integration into applications.

##Data Set
the used dataset is a collection of labeled tweets, including slang word
